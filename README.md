## Todolist REST API
---

### Introduction

This software was written solely in Go and provides a simple REST API to manage ToDos with CRUD operations. For each ToDo different tasks can be added. The application supports basic auth with api key. Input JSON are validated and strings like name or description get sanitized before storage. For Storage Postgres is used. However, also another database can be used with only slight adjustment as database access is abstract with the GORM ORM that supports different relational databases.

### Key Dependencies
- [Go](https://golang.org): This project uses Go to create a reliable, fast and efficient todolist REST API.
- [GORM](https://gorm.io): This project uses the GORM go ORM to abstract the database and allow simple and reliable database access.
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org): Postgres is used as SQL database of choice.
- [Mux](https://github.com/gorilla/mux): As router gorilla mux is used.

## Installation
---

The repository is already prepared for deployment on Heroku and different options are provided to run the todolist API locally.

## Local
The Docker-Compose.yml, multi-stage Dockerfile, Visual Studio Code Workspace or just the go sources and module can be used to run the todolist REST API locally. Depending on which solution is chosen and your Postgres Settings please adjust the ```.env``` / ```Dockerfile``` file accordingly.

1. #### Debug
    To debug the todolist REST API it is recommended to install Visual Studio Code and open the provided todolist.code-workspace.

    Note: Before running any code, please adjust the ```.env``` file and run the following command:
    ```
    source .env
    ```

1. #### Binary
    It is also possible to just use ```go build``` and run the binary. 
    
    Note: Before running any code, please adjust the ```.env``` file and run the following command:
    ```
    source .env
    ```

3. #### Docker-Compose
    To run the todolist REST API as Docker container, feel free to use the provided ```docker-compose.yml```. It also generates a PostgreSQL docker image that can be used as database. Otherwise the corresponding container can be deactivated after build and a local or online PostgreSQL solution can be used.

    Note: The ```docker-compose.yml``` uses the ```.env``` file. This should overwrite the ENV variables defined in the ```Dockerfile```. Therfore before running any code adjust the ```.env``` file accordingly and run the following command:
    ```
    source .env
    ```
    
    Run the following command to create the docker containers: 
    ```
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up
    ```

4. #### Dockerfile
    To use a already existing local or online PostgreSQL installation you can directly use the ```multi-stage Dockerfile```. The multi-stage Dockerfile specifies build stage with a full-fledged golang image and copies the static binary into a minimalistic docker container with minimal resource usage and without shell for production!
    
    Note: The Dockerfile is prepared for Heroku deployment. Therefore enviroment variables are set for Heroku PostgreSQL. Before compose, adjust ```Dockerfile``` with correct environment variables based on the prefered PostgreSQL settings.
    
    Run the following command to create the docker image: 
    ```
    docker build -t todolist .
    ```

    Note: Please ensure that port 8000 is set when running the todolist image for local testing.

## Deployment
The todolist REST API is already deployed on Heroku and reachable under the url provided in the todolist_heroku.postman_environment.json: https://todolist-koch.herokuapp.com

The following steps are necessary to deploy the todolist on Heroku yourself:
1. Create new app on Heroku
2. Chose deployment with Heroku git
3. Ideally test Dockerfile locally first
4. Add Heroku Postgres as Add-On in Heroku
5. Copy Heroku Postgres Info into ENV variables in Dockerfile and Heroku.yml. environment Variable PORT will be generated by Heroku and overwrites setting in Docker container.
6. Install Heroku CLI and run the following commands:
7. $ heroku login
8. $ heroku git:remote -a <heroku_app_name>
9. $ heroku stack:set container
10. $ git push heroku main

The deployment is started automatically by pushing the repository to the git of the Heroku app.

Note: The heroku.yml also allows to define a realease phase. The release phase allows testing your docker build before deployment. If the test in the release phase fails the docker container will not be deployed. For future version a release phase could be added to further improve the deployment process.

## Testing
---

The unittest in routes_test.go can be used for local testing or in the release stage of deployment. Additionally a postman collection is provided that can be used to test the local installation or the deployed endpoint in the release phase or in production.

### 1. Unittest
The unittest allows quick testing of the provided golang code during development and automatic testing during deployment. With the provided Visual Studio Workspace it is also possible to debug the unittest.

Currently routes_test.go runs 58 tests that cover most parts of the software. In the future further tests can be added to also trigger some of the more specific error cases. To get a detailed overview of the code coverage please run:
```
go test -coverprofile=coverage.out
go tool cover -html=coverage.out
```

Example unittest output:

### 1. Postman
A Postman collection is provided to test the endpoints. The Postman collection allows to test the todolist REST API locally, as well as in the release stage or in production by adjusting the ```domain``` Postman environment variable. For testing over the command line install Newman. Newman also allows automated testing.

Note: The ```key``` Postman collection variable must match with the .env file and the heroku.yml / Dockerfile. The ```domain``` Postman environment variable must match with the domain of the corresponding todolist REST API!

To run the tests in postman import the provided collection and the provided environments. The provided postman collection and postman heroku environment can also be used to test the already deployed solution.

To run the postman collection with newman, please type the following command for the already deployed Heroku todolist REST API:
```
newman run todolist.postman_collection.json -e todolist_heroku.postman_environment.json
```

To run the postman collection with newman to test locally or another deployment adjust the domain env var with the following command:
```
newman run todolist.postman_collection.json --env-var "domain=http://localhost:8000"
```

Example Newman Output:

## Controllers / Routes
---
Todolist REST API Controllers / Routes.

Note: All Routes expect an api key for basic auth. The api key can be configured in the ```TODOLIST_API_KEY``` env variable. For future version a list of api keys could be implemented. However, this would also require an additional API to provide and manage the API KEYs for different clients.

## GET index
```
GET /
```
Soft redirect to GET /todos

## GET todos
```
GET /todos
```
Returns a JSON with a complete list of todos and theire tasks.

## POST todos
```
POST /todos
```
Expects a JSON with a todo that may have multiple tasks. However, the JSON shall not include any "id" fields!

Example request JSON:

    "description" : "write a REST API in go for a simple todo list. Each todo can have multiple subtodos called tasks",
    "tasks":[
